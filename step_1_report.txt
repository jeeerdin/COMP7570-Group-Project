RAM specs: 16GB
CPU specs: 4 Cores, 2 Threads per core, 2.3 GHz

To avoid running out of memory, we read the data in one month at a time and linked the transactions as we read the data.
For this reason it is not possible to differentiate the I/O time and linking. 
Additionally, we applied several preprocessing steps to the data for greater memory efficiency. 
We will report this preprocessing time as well as the reading/linking time.

preprocessing time: 2202 seconds

reading/linking time: 1504 seconds

The memory taken by the final output is 760 MB


Notes:
We were only able to link 7 months before running out of data. A 32GB machine would be needed to link all of the data.
