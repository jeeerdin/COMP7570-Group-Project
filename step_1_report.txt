Specs for computer:
RAM specs: 32GB, 3200MHz
CPU specs: 6 Cores, 2 Threads per core, 3.7 GHz

To avoid running out of memory, we read the data in one month at a time and linked the transactions as we read the data.
For this reason it is not possible to differentiate the I/O time and linking. 
Additionally, we applied several preprocessing steps to the data for greater memory efficiency. 
We will report this preprocessing time as well as the reading/linking time.

preprocessing time: 1346.699 seconds

reading/linking time: 2890.841 seconds

The memory taken by the final output is 760 MB
